  Travel Guide in the Known Universe of STAR WARS
      </h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to this travel guide about the <strong class="Known-Universe">Known Universe</strong> 
          in <strong class="Star-Wars">Star Wars</strong>, 
          home to <strong>3.2 million planets</strong>, although about 45 are shown in the movies.
          Hopefully, this travel guide would give you a quick glimpse of how diverse this universe,
          the dangerous, and the <em>beauty</em> it has.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Coruscant">
        Coruscant
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Capital of the <strong class="Known-Universe">Known Universe</strong> in 
        <strong class="Star-Wars">Star Wars</strong>, 
        Coruscant is a city-scaped planet that is home to roughly 2 trillion people, humans and other
        sentients alike. 
      </p>

      <p>
        If you love the city, then Coruscant is the place to go. However, be wary of how large the planet is. 
        Deep underground, is where the underworld is and it's very dangerous there, somewhere tourists definitely
        should not check out. Even the Jedi don't have much power and reign there. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="Kashyyyk">
        Kashyyyk
      </h2>
      <p>
        Home of the Wookie species, Kashyyyk is covered in a dense forest of Worsyhr Trees, trees that can grow up 
        1,000 feet tall and live for 50,000 years. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Although a beautiful place, Wookies have a history of being enslaved, so they are very wary of foreigners.
        Wookies are also multiple times stronger than the average human, with an average height of 7'2", and can live
        for over <strong>400 years</strong>. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="Tatooine">
        Tatooine
      </h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the harsh, desert planet of Tatooine within the Outer Rim of the 
        <strong class="Known-Universe">Known Universe</strong>.
        Tatooine orbits a twin star system, creating a dynamic and a must-see sunset. Tatooine is also home to 
        two native species, the Jawas and the Tuskens. Jawas are scavengers, so they don't pose much of a danger,
        however Tuskens are known as Tusken Raiders and they are known to be vicious, so always watch where you 
        sleep at night!
      </p>
      <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/a2371b14-78cb-4700-b9f3-a05589c3cfcf/Tatooine_(fictional_desert_planet).jpg?v=1728396797042" height="300">

      <p>
        Tatooine is located in the <strong>Outer Rim</strong>, where it is out of reach by any government, 
        causing the planet to be
        a lawless place filled with runaways, criminals, and smugglers. And do be careful of the <em>Hutt Clan</em>,
        the major power on Tatooine. If your not careful and get on the wrong side of the Hutts, you might end up
        getting chased by bounty hunters and get frozen in carbonite, in a state of living, yet frozen.
